### Introduction For Dom
before doing this, let’s have a short overview of what this API offers to developers:
First of all, it allows access to a certain part of the document (the HTML markup). You can access a certain markup element using its identifier, or a collection of elements by their name, class type (according to the values of the element’s class attribute), their tag name (for example all <h1> elements), and several other aspects.
